This is the README file for Haiti Reporter, written by Dennis Cahillane (dcahilla@gmail.com) for Digital Democracy (www.digital-democracy.org).

Haiti Reporter is GPL, except for the modified CSS file I found somewhere on the Internet.

To get Haiti Reporter working on your system:

use the database.sql file to create your MySQL database with mysqldump

add a mysql user with read/write privileges to the tables

put that user's credentials into the login.php file

add a salt to changepassword.php and adduser.php. (Exercise #1: rewrite these files to use bcrypt). The relevant variables are called $salt1 and $salt2

To create the first user, you'll need to manually salt and hash your password buy cutting and pasting the relevant code from adduser.php into a new php file, then INSERTing the result into the table using the mysql command line tool.

Put all the files in an apache html directory, make sure that your apache httpd.conf supports php. Then visit index.php in your browser and log in. I hope you speak French or Haitian Creole.

If this is a public site use SSL to avoid man in the middle password attacks.

To edit fields in the dossier, you need to edit five files. insert.php insertform.php update.php updaterecord.php view.php

When editting fields, you should not completely delete old fields. If you do, that will mess up old records that use that field.
